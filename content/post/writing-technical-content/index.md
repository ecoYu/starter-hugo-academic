## Abstract

Trust is an important social capital. This paper regards the 1976 Tangshanearthquake as a natural experiment. Based on CGSS survey data from 20 districts and counties around the epicenter during 2010-2015, a cohort DID approach was used to study how individuals' experiences of natural disasters in their early years affect their future social trust. The study found that the stronger the individual experienced earthquake disaster in his youth (8-21 years old), the more his future social trust was impaired. The weakening of social activities caused by earthquake disaster or its important mechanism. At the same time, the degree of trust loss varies depending on the social environment in which individuals grow. This study provides necessary supplements to a few studies that consider the longterm impact of historical events on social trust.
